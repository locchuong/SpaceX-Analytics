# API Layer

In this project, we use **Axios** and **Tanstack Query** as our API layer for managing data fetching and state management. Tanstack Query is a powerful library that simplifies data fetching and manipulation by abstracting away the complexities of interacting with APIs and managing remote data.

## Examples

[Axios - API Client Example Code](../src/lib/axios.ts)

[Tanstack Query - API Request Declaration Example Code](../src/features/astronaut/api/getAstronauts.ts)
