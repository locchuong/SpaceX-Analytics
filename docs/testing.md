Vitest is the unit testing framework built on top of Vite and is an excellent unit test framework with many modern features.

#### [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

Cypress is a tool for running e2e tests in an automated way.
You define all the commands a real world user would execute when using the app and then start the test.

Cypress can be ran through the command `npm run dev`
